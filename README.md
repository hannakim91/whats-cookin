# What's Cookin'?
### Mod 2 - Paired Project

[**What's Cookin'**](https://hannakim91.github.io/whats-cookin/src/index.html) is an application where users can see a library of recipes and view details for each recipe. Users can flag recipes and add and remove them from their favorites list by toggling a button. Users can search for recipes by exact name (for now).

What's Cookin' was built with vanilla JavaScript using Mocha as a testing framework.

## Set Up

1. To run the app locally: clone [this repo](git@github.com:hannakim91/whats-cookin.git).
2. Change into your cloned repo's directory,
3. Install project dependencies.
4. Open the HTML page.

```
git clone git@github.com:hannakim91/whats-cookin-starter-kit.git
cd [cloned directory location]
npm install
open src/index.html
```

## Wins and Challenges

### Wins
* We coded basic functionality for the app as a team without much outside input initially.
* We refactored a multipurpose anti-DRY very WET function (50+ lines) that combined data model and dom all in one initially to having functionality in the correct places and DRYing up code.
* We got closer to the MVP than we expected a couple of days ago with how slowly things were progressing.

### Challenges
* Figuring out what to do when without Iterations provided - learning about how to use tickets for project management
* Figuring out basic architecture for the app - knowing what methods should belong to each class.
* Human/life elements - one of the team members was sick for half the project timespan.

## Team
